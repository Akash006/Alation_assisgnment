    redis        ClusterIP      10.101.209.60   <none>         6379/TCP         3m3s
   ```
7. Verify application
    > curl $(minikube service lb-svc --url)
    ```
    [centos@centos7 Alation_assisgnment]$ curl $(minikube service lb-svc --url)
    Hola! we have hit 1 times
    [centos@centos7 Alation_assisgnment]$ curl $(minikube service lb-svc --url)
    Hola! we have hit 2 times
    [centos@centos7 Alation_assisgnment]$
    ```

# Bonus questions
1. Brief summary of what you liked about your solution
    ```
    ðŸ˜… Finally working prototype is ready
    ðŸš© Option to update the replicaset
    ðŸ’¡ Option to update image and tags
    ðŸŽˆ Image customization option.
    ```
2. Briefly summarize of what you disliked about your solution
    ```
    ðŸ˜Ÿ There are lot of things which could be done in a better way as per the industry standards.
    ðŸš€ Can give more customization option in value.yaml file like:
        - resources
        - image pull policy
        - Option for Load Balancer IP
        - etc etc
    ðŸŒ‹ Redis can also be deployed as deployemnt and can have replications but as I'm using minikube it has some limitation with storage class. So won't be able to implement that in this solution.
    ðŸ”¥ More comments must be added to enhance readability.
